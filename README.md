# Welcome to My GitHub 👋

Hi, I’m **Min** — a Computer Science graduate (First Class, University of Hertfordshire).  
I specialise in **data engineering, backend systems, and cloud-native development**, with a passion for building reliable, scalable, and intelligent data-driven applications.  

This GitHub is my space to document projects, experiments, and systems I’m building as I grow into a cloud-native data engineer.
